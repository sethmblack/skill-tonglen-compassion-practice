## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| input_data | Yes | The primary data or content to analyze |
| context | No | Additional background or constraints (default: none) |
| output_format | No | Preferred format for results (default: structured markdown) |

## The Practice Framework

### Phase 1: Preparation (2-3 minutes)

**Physical Setup:**
- Sit comfortably with spine straight but relaxed
- Close eyes or soften gaze downward
- Take several deep breaths to settle

**Mental Setup:**
- Set intention: "May this practice benefit myself and all beings"
- Recognize your own wish for happiness and freedom from suffering
- Acknowledge that all beings share this wish

---

### Phase 2: Self-Compassion Foundation (3-5 minutes)

**Critical Principle:** You cannot give what you do not have. Always begin with yourself.

**Practice:**
1. Connect with any personal suffering, difficulty, or struggle you're experiencing
2. **Breathing in:** Visualize taking in your own suffering as dark smoke or heavy cloud
3. **Breathing out:** Send yourself healing light, warmth, and relief
4. Feel the suffering dissolving and being transformed within you
5. Continue until you feel some genuine self-compassion arising

**Key Insight:** This is not about wallowing in suffering but acknowledging it with kindness and offering yourself the compassion you would offer a dear friend.

---

### Phase 3: Extending to a Loved One (3-5 minutes)

**Choose someone:**
- A person you love who is currently struggling
- Someone whose suffering is easy for you to feel

**Practice:**
1. Visualize them clearly, sensing their difficulty
2. **Breathing in:** Take in their suffering (dark smoke) through your heart center
3. **Breathing out:** Send them healing, happiness, and relief (bright light)
4. Feel their suffering transforming within you
5. Continue until you feel genuine compassion flowing

**Note:** You are not literally taking on their suffering. The visualization transforms your relationship to suffering, not the suffering itself.

---

### Phase 4: Neutral Person (3-5 minutes)

**Choose someone:**
- Someone you neither like nor dislike
- A stranger, acquaintance, or someone seen in passing

**Practice:**
1. Recognize this person has the same wish for happiness you have
2. Acknowledge they experience suffering just as you do
3. **Breathing in:** Take in their suffering
4. **Breathing out:** Send them happiness and wellbeing
5. Notice any resistance and continue gently

**Purpose:** Extends compassion beyond personal attachment, developing universal care.

---

### Phase 5: Difficult Person (3-5 minutes)

**Choose someone:**
- Someone you find challenging, annoying, or who has hurt you
- Start with mild difficulty, work up gradually over time

**Practice:**
1. Remember this person also wants happiness and fears suffering
2. Recognize that their harmful actions arise from their own confusion and pain
3. **Breathing in:** Take in their suffering (the suffering that causes them to act harmfully)
4. **Breathing out:** Send them peace, clarity, and freedom from the suffering that drives their harmful behavior
5. Notice resistance without judgment; continue gently

**Key Insight:** You are not condoning harmful actions. You are recognizing that hurt people hurt people, and wishing freedom from the suffering that causes harm.

---

### Phase 6: All Beings (2-3 minutes)

**Expansion:**
1. Extend awareness to all beings everywhere
2. Recognize the universal experience of suffering
3. **Breathing in:** Take in the suffering of all beings
4. **Breathing out:** Send happiness, peace, and freedom to all beings
5. Rest in the sense of interconnection

---

### Phase 7: Dedication (1 minute)

**Closing:**
- "May this practice benefit all beings"
- "May all beings be free from suffering and its causes"
- "May all beings have happiness and its causes"
- Rest in the intention, then gently return to normal awareness

---

## Common Challenges and Responses

| Challenge | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "I can't feel anything" | Start with self-compassion; recall a time you felt genuine care |
| "I'm afraid I'll absorb their suffering" | The visualization transforms suffering; you're not literally taking it on |
| "I can't do this for that person" | Return to easier targets; difficult people are advanced practice |
| "It feels fake" | Genuine feeling develops with practice; even aspiration matters |
| "I feel overwhelmed" | Take breaks; return to self-compassion; shorter sessions |

---

## Variations

### Flash Tonglen
- Use in daily life when encountering suffering
- Single breath: breathe in their pain, breathe out relief
- Takes seconds, develops habit of compassionate response

### Tonglen for Specific Suffering
- Focus on one type of suffering (illness, grief, loneliness)
- Breathe in that suffering from all who experience it
- Breathe out healing specific to that suffering

### Tonglen for Global Situations
- Visualize suffering from current events, crises, disasters
- Take in collective suffering
- Send healing and relief to all affected

---

## The Transformation Principle

**What Actually Happens:**

Tonglen works not by literally absorbing suffering but by:

1. **Breaking the habit of aversion** - We normally push suffering away; tonglen reverses this
2. **Dissolving the self/other boundary** - Recognizing our shared experience of suffering
3. **Transforming helplessness into agency** - We can always offer compassion
4. **Developing courage** - Willingness to face suffering rather than avoid it
5. **Opening the heart** - Repetition creates genuine warmth and connection

---

## Integration with Daily Life

**Practices:**
- Do formal tonglen daily (even 5-10 minutes)
- Practice flash tonglen throughout the day
- When feeling irritation, briefly do tonglen for the irritating person
- When seeing news of suffering, take a tonglen breath
- Before difficult conversations, do tonglen for the other person

**Signs of Progress:**
- More natural compassionate responses
- Reduced fear of your own and others' suffering
- Greater emotional resilience
- Increased sense of connection with others
- Less reactivity to difficult people

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Collect all relevant information:
- Review the provided data and context
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

## Output Format

When guiding someone through tonglen:

1. **Assess readiness** - Check their current emotional state and experience
2. **Explain the principle** - Why taking in suffering transforms rather than harms
3. **Guide self-compassion first** - Never skip this foundation
4. **Progress through stages** - Loved one, neutral, difficult, all beings
5. **Address resistance** - Normalize challenges and offer alternatives
6. **Provide integration** - Daily life applications
7. **Encourage consistency** - Regular practice matters more than perfect sessions
